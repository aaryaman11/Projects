3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Register Allocation by Graph Coloring)
      Approach: for this problem, I first watched the Register Allocation videos, and followed the pdf instructions
      to understand what I need to do for the project. I used NNaiveRegisterAllocator.java as a model to understand, how
      to access an interval for virtual registers. The liveness intervals were already implemented, and we called them
      using BuildInterval method. I implemented the graph using hashmap and set to add vertex, edges and also to
      check if there is a vertex or not for the interference graph. I wasn't sure how to build the adjacency matrix, I
      asked james, and he told me use the helper function isCollision(NInterval a, NInterval b) to make matrix and also
      to check if the intervals are overlapping.

      Issues and resolution: one of the  issues I got was when I was implementing the hashmap, as I was getting error
      related to cannot resolve symbol or the method was not implemented properly. I google the implementation of HashMap
      to resolve those issues. The other issue, I was getting was in implementing the isCollision and making adjacency
      matrix, which james helped me to figure it out
